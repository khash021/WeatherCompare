# WeatherCompare
A weather comparing Android App

This app will show you the forecast from 3 different weather services, side by side. This makes it easier to compare weather data and make a judgemnt call. 

It allows the user to either search by city name, zip code, or simply use their location (permission required). 

Settings offers unit changes for different weather data.

This is a work in progress.
